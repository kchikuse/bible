'Both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, "Behold, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they had hidden themselves!"',
'The men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer, and said, "Come up to us, and we will show you something!"',
'Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his armor bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor bearer killed them after him.',
'That first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow’s length in an acre of land.',
'There was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the raiders, also trembled; and the earth quaked, so there was an exceedingly great trembling.',
'The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away and scattered.',
'Then Saul said to the people who were with him, "Count now, and see who is missing from us." When they had counted, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there.',
'Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring God’s ark here." For God’s ark was with the children of Israel at that time.',
'While Saul talked to the priest, the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased; and Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand!"',
'Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle; and behold, they were all striking each other with their swords in very great confusion.',
'Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines before, and who went up with them into the camp, from all around, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.',
'Likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.',
'So the LORD saved Israel that day; and the battle passed over by Beth Aven.',
'The men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, "Cursed is the man who eats any food until it is evening, and I am avenged of my enemies." So none of the people tasted food.',
'All the people came into the forest; and there was honey on the ground.',
'When the people had come to the forest, behold, honey was dripping, but no one put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.',
'But Jonathan didn’t hear when his father commanded the people with the oath. Therefore he put out the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes brightened.',
'Then one of the people answered, and said, "Your father directly commanded the people with an oath, saying, ‘Cursed is the man who eats food today.’" So the people were faint.',
'Then Jonathan said, "My father has troubled the land. Please look how my eyes have brightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.',
'How much more, if perhaps the people had eaten freely today of the plunder of their enemies which they found? For now there has been no great slaughter among the Philistines."',
'They struck the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. The people were very faint;',
'and the people pounced on the plunder, and took sheep, cattle, and calves, and killed them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.',
'Then they told Saul, saying, "Behold, the people are sinning against the LORD, in that they eat meat with the blood."',
'Saul said, "Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them, ‘Every man bring me here his ox, and every man his sheep, and kill them here, and eat; and don’t sin against the LORD in eating meat with the blood.’" All the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and killed them there.',
'Saul built an altar to the LORD. This was the first altar that he built to the LORD.',
'Saul said, "Let’s go down after the Philistines by night, and take plunder among them until the morning light, and let’s not leave a man of them."',
'Saul asked counsel of God, "Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?" But he didn’t answer him that day.',
'Saul said, "Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people; and know and see in which this sin has been today.',
'For, as the LORD lives, who saves Israel, though it is in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die." But there was not a man among all the people who answered him.',
'Then he said to all Israel, "You be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side."',
'Therefore Saul said to the LORD, the God of Israel, "Show the right."',
'Saul said, "Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son."',
'Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done!"',
'Saul said, "God do so and more also; for you shall surely die, Jonathan."',
'The people said to Saul, "Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it! As the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has worked with God today!" So the people rescued Jonathan, that he didn’t die.',
'Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.',
'Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned himself, he defeated them.',
'He did valiantly, and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.',
'Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal.',
'The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.',
'Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.',
'There was severe war against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him into his service.'

'Samuel said, "Though you were little in your own sight, weren’t you made the head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel;',

'Saul said to Samuel, "But I have obeyed the LORD’s voice, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.',
'But the people took of the plunder, sheep and cattle, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal."',
'Samuel said, "Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the LORD’s voice? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.',

'Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD."',
'Samuel said to Saul, "I will not return with you; for you have rejected the LORD’s word, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel."',
'As Samuel turned around to go away, Saul grabbed the skirt of his robe, and it tore.',

'David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, "What have I done? What is my iniquity? What is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?"',
'He said to him, "Far from it; you will not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small, but that he discloses it to me. Why would my father hide this thing from me? It is not so."',
'David swore moreover, and said, "Your father knows well that I have found favor in your eyes; and he says, ‘Don’t let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved;’ but truly as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death."',
'Then Jonathan said to David, "Whatever your soul desires, I will even do it for you."',
'David said to Jonathan, "Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to dine with the king; but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening.',
'If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.’',
'If he says, ‘It is well,’ your servant shall have peace; but if he is angry, then know that evil is determined by him.',
'Therefore deal kindly with your servant; for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you; but if there is iniquity in me, kill me yourself; for why should you bring me to your father?"',
'Jonathan said, "Far be it from you; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come on you, then wouldn’t I tell you that?"',
'Then David said to Jonathan, "Who will tell me if your father answers you roughly?"',
'Jonathan said to David, "Come! Let’s go out into the field." They both went out into the field.',
'Jonathan said to David, "By the LORD, the God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if there is good toward David, won’t I then send to you, and disclose it to you?',
'The LORD do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do you evil, if I don’t disclose it to you, and send you away, that you may go in peace. May the LORD be with you, as he has been with my father.',
'You shall not only show me the loving kindness of the LORD while I still live, that I not die;',
'but you shall also not cut off your kindness from my house forever; no, not when the LORD has cut off every one of the enemies of David from the surface of the earth."',

'When you have stayed three days, go down quickly, and come to the place where you hid yourself when this started, and remain by the stone Ezel.',
'I will shoot three arrows on its side, as though I shot at a mark.',
'Behold, I will send the boy, saying, ‘Go, find the arrows!’ If I tell the boy, ‘Behold, the arrows are on this side of you. Take them;’ then come; for there is peace to you and no danger, as the LORD lives.',
'But if I say this to the boy, ‘Behold, the arrows are beyond you;’ then go your way; for the LORD has sent you away.',
'Concerning the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD is between you and me forever."',

'Nevertheless Saul didn’t say anything that day, for he thought, "Something has happened to him. He is not clean. Surely he is not clean."',
'On the next day after the new moon, the second day, David’s place was empty. Saul said to Jonathan his son, "Why doesn’t the son of Jesse come to eat, either yesterday, or today?"',
'Jonathan answered Saul, "David earnestly asked permission of me to go to Bethlehem.',
'He said, ‘Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city. My brother has commanded me to be there. Now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me go away and see my brothers.’ Therefore he has not come to the king’s table."',
'Then Saul’s anger burned against Jonathan, and he said to him, "You son of a perverse rebellious woman, don’t I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?',
'For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you will not be established, nor will your kingdom. Therefore now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die!"',
'Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, "Why should he be put to death? What has he done?"',
'Saul cast his spear at him to strike him. By this Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death.',
'So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had treated him shamefully.',
'In the morning, Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little boy with him.',
'He said to his boy, "Run, find now the arrows which I shoot." As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.',
'When the boy had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the boy, and said, "Isn’t the arrow beyond you?"',
'Jonathan cried after the boy, "Go fast! Hurry! Don’t delay!" Jonathan’s boy gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.',
'But the boy didn’t know anything. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter.',
'Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to him, "Go, carry them to the city."',
'As soon as the boy was gone, David arose out of the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times. They kissed one another, and wept one with another, and David wept the most.',
'Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, because we have both sworn in the LORD’s name, saying, ‘The LORD is between me and you, and between my offspring and your offspring, forever.’" He arose and departed; and Jonathan went into the city.'

'Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, answered, "Don’t let my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.',
'Now therefore don’t let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead; for only Amnon is dead."',
'But Absalom fled. The young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him.',
'Jonadab said to the king, "Behold, the king’s sons are coming! It is as your servant said."',
'As soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept. The king also and all his servants wept bitterly.',
'But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. David mourned for his son every day.',
'So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.',
'King David longed to go out to Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead.'

'14': [
'Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was toward Absalom.',
'Joab sent to Tekoa, and brought a wise woman from there, and said to her, "Please act like a mourner, and put on mourning clothing, please, and don’t anoint yourself with oil, but be as a woman who has mourned a long time for the dead.',
'Go in to the king, and speak like this to him." So Joab put the words in her mouth.',
'When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, showed respect, and said, "Help, O king!"',
'The king said to her, "What ails you?"',
'Your servant had two sons, and they both fought together in the field, and there was no one to part them, but the one struck the other, and killed him.',
'Behold, the whole family has risen against your servant, and they say, ‘Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he killed, and so destroy the heir also.’ Thus they would quench my coal which is left, and would leave to my husband neither name nor remainder on the surface of the earth."',
'The king said to the woman, "Go to your house, and I will give a command concerning you."',
'The woman of Tekoa said to the king, "My lord, O king, may the iniquity be on me, and on my father’s house; and may the king and his throne be guiltless."',
'The king said, "Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me, and he will not bother you any more."',
'Then she said, "Please let the king remember the LORD your God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son."',
'Then the woman said, "Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king."',
'The woman said, "Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word the king is as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring home again his banished one.',
'For we must die, and are like water spilled on the ground, which can’t be gathered up again; neither does God take away life, but devises means, that he who is banished not be an outcast from him.',
'Now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid. Your servant said, ‘I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.’',
'For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.',
'Then your servant said, ‘Please let the word of my lord the king bring rest; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad. May the LORD, your God, be with you.’"',
'Then the king answered the woman, "Please don’t hide anything from me that I ask you."',
'The king said, "Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?"',
'Your servant Joab has done this thing to change the face of the matter. My lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth."',
'The king said to Joab, "Behold now, I have done this thing. Go therefore, and bring the young man Absalom back."',
'Joab fell to the ground on his face, showed respect, and blessed the king. Joab said, "Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant."',
'So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.',
'The king said, "Let him return to his own house, but let him not see my face." So Absalom returned to his own house, and didn’t see the king’s face.',
'Now in all Israel there was no one to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty. From the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no defect in him.',
'When he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year’s end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels,<f caller="+"> <fr>14:26 </fr><ft>A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces, so 200 shekels is about 2 kilograms or about 4.4 pounds.</ft></f> after the king’s weight.',
'Three sons were born to Absalom, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar. She was a woman with a beautiful face.',
'Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, and he didn’t see the king’s face.',
'Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. Then he sent again a second time, but he would not come.',
'Therefore he said to his servants, "Behold, Joab’s field is near mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire." So Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.',
'Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said to him, "Why have your servants set my field on fire?"',
'Absalom answered Joab, "Behold, I sent to you, saying, ‘Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, "Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king’s face, and if there is iniquity in me, let him kill me."’"',
'So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom.'

'15': [
'After this, Absalom prepared a chariot and horses for himself, and fifty men to run before him.',
'Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate. When any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, "What city are you from?"',
'Absalom said to him, "Behold, your matters are good and right; but there is no man deputized by the king to hear you."',
'Absalom said moreover, "Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!"',
'It was so, that when any man came near to bow down to him, he stretched out his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.',
'Absalom did this sort of thing to all Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.',
'At the end of forty years, Absalom said to the king, "Please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the LORD, in Hebron.',
'For your servant vowed a vow while I stayed at Geshur in Syria, saying, ‘If the LORD shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.’"',
'The king said to him, "Go in peace."',
'But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, "As soon as you hear the sound of the shofar, then you shall say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron!’"',
'Two hundred men went with Absalom out of Jerusalem, who were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they didn’t know anything.',
'Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. The conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.',
'A messenger came to David, saying, "The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom."',
'David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, "Arise! Let’s flee; or else none of us will escape from Absalom. Hurry to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil on us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword."',
'The king’s servants said to the king, "Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king chooses."',
'The king went out, and all his household after him. The king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep the house.',
'The king went out, and all the people after him; and they stayed in Beth Merhak.',
'All his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.',
'Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why do you also go with us? Return, and stay with the king; for you are a foreigner, and also an exile. Return to your own place.',
'Whereas you came but yesterday, should I today make you go up and down with us, since I go where I may? Return, and take back your brothers. Mercy and truth be with you."',
'Ittai answered the king, and said, "As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king is, whether for death or for life, your servant will be there also."',
'David said to Ittai, "Go and pass over." Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones who were with him.',
'All the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over. The king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.',
'Behold, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down God’s ark; and Abiathar went up, until all the people finished passing out of the city.',
'The king said to Zadok, "Carry God’s ark back into the city. If I find favor in the LORD’s eyes, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation;',
'but if he says, ‘I have no delight in you;’ behold, here I am. Let him do to me as seems good to him."',
'The king said also to Zadok the priest, "Aren’t you a seer? Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.',
'Behold, I will stay at the fords of the wilderness, until word comes from you to inform me."',
'Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried God’s ark to Jerusalem again; and they stayed there.',
'David went up by the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot. All the people who were with him each covered his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.',
'Someone told David, saying, "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom."',
'When David had come to the top, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his tunic torn, and earth on his head.',
'David said to him, "If you pass on with me, then you will be a burden to me;',
'but if you return to the city, and tell Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king. As I have been your father’s servant in time past, so I will now be your servant; then will you defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.’',
'Don’t you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you? Therefore whatever you hear out of the king’s house, tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.',
'Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son. Send to me everything that you shall hear by them."',
'So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem.'

'When David was a little past the top, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of donkeys saddled, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, and one hundred clusters of raisins, and one hundred summer fruits, and a container of wine.',
'The king said to Ziba, "What do you mean by these?"',
'The king said, "Where is your master’s son?"',
'Then the king said to Ziba, "Behold, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours."',
'When king David came to Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of Saul’s house came out, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera. He came out and cursed as he came.',
'He cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.',
'Shimei said when he cursed, "Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, and wicked fellow!',
'The LORD has returned on you all the blood of Saul’s house, in whose place you have reigned! The LORD has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son! Behold, you are caught by your own mischief, because you are a man of blood!"',
'Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and take off his head."',
'The king said, "What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because the LORD has said to him, ‘Curse David;’ who then shall say, ‘Why have you done so?’"',
'David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, "Behold, my son, who came out of my bowels, seeks my life. How much more this Benjamite, now? Leave him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD has invited him.',
'It may be that the LORD will look on the wrong done to me, and that the LORD will repay me good for the cursing of me today."',
'So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him, and cursed as he went, threw stones at him, and threw dust.',
'The king, and all the people who were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.',
'Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.',
'When Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, had come to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, "Long live the king! Long live the king!"',
'Absalom said to Hushai, "Is this your kindness to your friend? Why didn’t you go with your friend?"',
'Hushai said to Absalom, "No; but whomever the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, I will be his, and I will stay with him.',
'Again, whom should I serve? Shouldn’t I serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father’s presence, so I will be in your presence."',
'Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give your counsel what we shall do."',
'Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Go in to your father’s concubines that he has left to keep the house. Then all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong."',
'So they spread a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.',
'The counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the inner sanctuary of God. All the counsel of Ahithophel both was like this with David and with Absalom.'

'Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Let me now choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David tonight.',

'and I will bring back all the people to you. The man whom you seek is as if all returned. All the people shall be in peace."',
'The saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.',
'Then Absalom said, "Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let’s hear likewise what he says."',
'When Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, "Ahithophel has spoken like this. Shall we do what he says? If not, speak up."',
'Hushai said to Absalom, "The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good."',
'Hushai said moreover, "You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are fierce in their minds, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.',
'Behold, he is now hidden in some pit, or in some other place. It will happen, when some of them have fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, ‘There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom!’',
'Even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.',
'But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person.',
'So we will come on him in some place where he will be found, and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground, then we will not leave so much as one of him and of all the men who are with him.',
'Moreover, if he has gone into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there isn’t one small stone found there."',
'Absalom and all the men of Israel said, "The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel." For the LORD had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil on Absalom.',
'Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, "Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel that way; and I have counseled this way.',
'Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, ‘Don’t lodge tonight at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.’"',
'Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En Rogel; and a female servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David. For they might not be seen to come into the city.',
'But a boy saw them, and told Absalom. Then they both went away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there.',
'The woman took and spread the covering over the well’s mouth, and spread out crushed grain on it; and nothing was known.',
'Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?"',
'After they had departed, they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said to David, "Arise and pass quickly over the water; for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you."',
'Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they passed over the Jordan. By the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan.',
'When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, arose, and went home, to his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father.',
'Then David came to Mahanaim. Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.',
'Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab’s mother.',
'Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.',
'When David had come to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,',
'brought beds, basins, earthen vessels, wheat, barley, meal, parched grain, beans, lentils, roasted grain,',
'honey, butter, sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people who were with him, to eat; for they said, "The people are hungry, weary, and thirsty in the wilderness."'

'David counted the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.',
'David sent the people out, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the people, "I will also surely go out with you myself."',
'But the people said, "You shall not go out; for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us out of the city."',
'The king said to them, "I will do what seems best to you."',
'The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, "Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom." All the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning Absalom.',

'Absalom happened to meet David’s servants. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the sky and earth; and the mule that was under him went on.',
'A certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, "Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak."',
'Joab said to the man who told him, "Behold, you saw it, and why didn’t you strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten pieces of silver, and a sash."',
'The man said to Joab, "Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I still wouldn’t stretch out my hand against the king’s son; for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, ‘Beware that no one touch the young man Absalom.’',
'Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hidden from the king), then you yourself would have set yourself against me."',
'Then Joab said, "I’m not going to wait like this with you." He took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the middle of the oak.',
'Ten young men who bore Joab’s armor surrounded and struck Absalom, and killed him.',
'Joab blew the shofar, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held the people back.',
'They took Absalom and cast him into a great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones. Then all Israel fled, each to his own tent.',
'Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar which is in the king’s valley, for he said, "I have no son to keep my name in memory." He called the pillar after his own name. It is called Absalom’s monument, to this day.',
'Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, "Let me now run and carry the king news, how the LORD has avenged him of his enemies."',

'The watchman said, "I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok."',
'Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, "All is well." He bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, "Blessed is the LORD your God, who has delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king!"',

'The king said, "Come and stand here." He came, and stood still.',
'Behold, the Cushite came. The Cushite said, "News for my lord the king, for the LORD has avenged you today of all those who rose up against you."',

'Your servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king repay me with such a reward?',
'Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you."',
'The king answered, "Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you. Whatever you request of me, that I will do for you."',

'The men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, "We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more claim to David than you.

'For the cherubim spread their wings out over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above.',
'The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the inner sanctuary; but they were not seen outside. They are there to this day.',
'There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.',

'‘Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.’',
'"Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.',

'Nevertheless, you shall not build the house; but your son who shall come out of your body, he shall build the house for my name.’',
'The LORD has established his word that he spoke; for I have risen up in the place of David my father, and I sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.',

'Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the LORD, twenty two thousand head of cattle, and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the LORD’s house.',
'The same day the king made the middle of the court holy that was before the LORD’s house; for there he offered the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings.',
'So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven more days, even fourteen days.',

'He said to his sons, saying, "Saddle the donkey for me," and they saddled it.',
'He went and found his body thrown on the path, and the donkey and the lion standing by the body. The lion had not eaten the body, nor mauled the donkey.',

'He got rid of the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places around Jerusalem; those also who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the army of the sky.',

'Nevertheless the priests of the high places didn’t come up to the LORD’s altar in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers.',

'He broke in pieces the pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, and filled their places with men’s bones.',
'Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah.',
'As Josiah turned himself, he spied the tombs that were there in the mountain; and he sent, and took the bones out of the tombs, and burned them on the altar, and defiled it, according to the LORD’s word which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things.',
'Then he said, "What monument is that which I see?"',

'There was no king like him before him, who turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the Torah of Moses; and there was none like him who arose after him.',
'Notwithstanding, the LORD didn’t turn from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which his anger burned against Judah, because of all the provocation with which Manasseh had provoked him.',
'The LORD said, "I will also remove Judah out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, ‘My name shall be there.’"',

'Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.',

'Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand. All Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honor in abundance.',
'His heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD. Furthermore, he took away the high places and the Asherah poles out of Judah.',
'Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;',

'They taught in Judah, having the book of the LORD’s law with them. They went about throughout all the cities of Judah and taught among the people.',
'The fear of the LORD fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.',
'Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute. The Arabians also brought him flocks, seven thousand seven hundred rams, and seven thousand seven hundred male goats.',
'Jehoshaphat grew great exceedingly; and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah.',
'He had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.',
'This was the numbering of them according to their fathers’ houses: From Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valor;',
'and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred eighty thousand;',

'Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, "Will you go with me to Ramoth Gilead?"',
'Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, "Please inquire first for the LORD’s word."',
'Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, "Shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?"',
'But Jehoshaphat said, "Isn’t there here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we may inquire of him?"',
'The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil. He is Micaiah the son of Imla."',
'Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, "Get Micaiah the son of Imla quickly."',
'Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah each sat on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.',
'Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made himself horns of iron and said, "The LORD says, ‘With these you shall push the Syrians, until they are consumed.’"',
'All the prophets prophesied so, saying, "Go up to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper; for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king."',
'The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, "Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth. Let your word therefore, please be like one of theirs, and speak good."',
'Micaiah said, "As the LORD lives, I will say what my God says."',
'When he had come to the king, the king said to him, "Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?"',
'The king said to him, "How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the LORD’s name?"',
'He said, "I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. The LORD said, ‘These have no master. Let them each return to his house in peace.’"',
'The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn’t I tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?"',
'Micaiah said, "Therefore hear the LORD’s word: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the army of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.',
'The LORD said, ‘Who will entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?’ One spoke saying in this way, and another saying in that way.',
'A spirit came out, stood before the LORD, and said, ‘I will entice him.’',
'"He said, ‘I will go, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’',
'"Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets; and the LORD has spoken evil concerning you."',
'Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, "Which way did the LORD’s Spirit go from me to speak to you?"',
'Micaiah said, "Behold, you shall see on that day, when you go into an inner room to hide yourself."',
'The king of Israel said, "Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;',
'and say, ‘The king says, "Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace."’"',
'Micaiah said, "If you return at all in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me." He said, "Listen, you people, all of you!"',
'So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.',
'The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but you put on your robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle.',
'Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, "Don’t fight with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel."',
'When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, "It is the king of Israel!" Therefore they turned around to fight against him. But Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.',
'When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.',
'A certain man drew his bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of the chariot, "Turn your hand, and carry me out of the army; for I am severely wounded."',

'But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell on the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Beth Horon, and struck of them three thousand, and took much plunder.',
'Now after Amaziah had come from the slaughter of the Edomites, he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense to them.',
'Therefore the LORD’s anger burned against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet, who said to him, "Why have you sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of your hand?"',
'As he talked with him, the king said to him, "Have we made you one of the king’s counselors? Stop! Why should you be struck down?"',
'Then Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, "Come! Let’s look one another in the face."',
'Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, "The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as his wife. Then a wild animal that was in Lebanon passed by, and trampled down the thistle.',

'When he was in distress, he begged the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.',
'He prayed to him; and he was entreated by him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD was God.',
'Now after this, he built an outer wall to David’s city, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate. He encircled Ophel with it, and raised it up to a very great height; and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.',
'He took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the LORD’s house, and all the altars that he had built in the mountain of the LORD’s house, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.',
'He built up the LORD’s altar, and offered sacrifices of peace offerings and of thanksgiving on it, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD, the God of Israel.',

'So Hilkiah, and they whom the king had commanded, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter), and they spoke to her to that effect.',
'She said to them, "The LORD, the God of Israel says: ‘Tell the man who sent you to me,',
'"The LORD says, ‘Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.',

'But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, you shall tell him this, ‘The LORD, the God of Israel says: "About the words which you have heard,',

'found his heart faithful before you, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it to his offspring, and have performed your words; for you are righteous.',
'"You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Sea of Suf,',
'and showed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, and against all his servants, and against all the people of his land; for you knew that they dealt proudly against them, and made a name for yourself, as it is today.',
'You divided the sea before them, so that they went through the middle of the sea on the dry land; and you cast their pursuers into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters.',
'Moreover, in a pillar of cloud you led them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way in which they should go.',
'"You also came down on Mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments,',
'and made known to them your holy Sabbath, and commanded them commandments, statutes, and a law, by Moses your servant,',
'and gave them bread from the sky for their hunger, and brought water out of the rock for them for their thirst, and commanded them that they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them.',
'"But they and our fathers behaved proudly, hardened their neck, didn’t listen to your commandments,',
'and refused to obey. They weren’t mindful of your wonders that you did among them, but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, and didn’t forsake them.',
'Yes, when they had made themselves a molded calf, and said, ‘This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,’ and had committed awful blasphemies;',
'yet you in your manifold mercies didn’t forsake them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud didn’t depart from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither did the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go.',
'You gave also your good Spirit to instruct them, and didn’t withhold your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst.',
'"Yes, forty years you sustained them in the wilderness. They lacked nothing. Their clothes didn’t grow old, and their feet didn’t swell.',
'Moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples, which you allotted according to their portions. So they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.',
'You also multiplied their children as the stars of the sky, and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.',
'"So the children went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they pleased.',
'They took fortified cities and a rich land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns dug out, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate, were filled, became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness.',
'"Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you, cast your law behind their back, killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you, and they committed awful blasphemies.',
'Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them. In the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors who saved them out of the hands of their adversaries.',
'But after they had rest, they did evil again before you; therefore you left them in the hands of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them; yet when they returned, and cried to you, you heard from heaven; and many times you delivered them according to your mercies,',
'and testified against them, that you might bring them again to your law. Yet they were arrogant, and didn’t listen to your commandments, but sinned against your ordinances (which if a man does, he shall live in them), turned their backs, stiffened their neck, and would not hear.',
'Yet many years you put up with them, and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets. Yet they would not listen. Therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.',
'"Nevertheless in your manifold mercies you didn’t make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for you are a gracious and merciful God.',
'Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness, don’t let all the travail seem little before you, that has come on us, on our kings, on our princes, on our priests, on our prophets, on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day.',
'However you are just in all that has come on us; for you have dealt truly, but we have done wickedly.',
'Also our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept your law, nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which you testified against them.',
'For they have not served you in their kingdom, and in your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and rich land which you gave before them. They didn’t turn from their wicked works.',
'"Behold, we are servants today, and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its good, behold, we are servants in it.',
'It yields much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins. Also they have power over our bodies and over our livestock, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.',
'Yet for all this, we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our Levites, and our priests, seal it."'

'When these days were fulfilled, the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Susa the palace, both great and small, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace.',
'There were hangings of white and blue material, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and marble pillars. The couches were of gold and silver, on a pavement of red, white, yellow, and black marble.',

'For this deed of the queen will become known to all women, causing them to show contempt for their husbands, when it is reported, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she didn’t come.’',
'Today, the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen’s deed will tell all the king’s princes. This will cause much contempt and wrath.',

'The young woman then came to the king like this: whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women’s house to the king’s house.',
'In the evening she went, and on the next day she returned into the second women’s house, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch, who kept the concubines. She came in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her, and she was called by name.',
'Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s eunuch, the keeper of the women, advised. Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked at her.',
'So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.',
'The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.',
'Then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces, and gave gifts according to the king’s bounty.',
'When the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate.',
'Esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people, as Mordecai had commanded her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai, like she did when she was brought up by him.',
'In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate, two of the king’s eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, who were doorkeepers, were angry, and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus.',
'This thing became known to Mordecai, who informed Esther the queen; and Esther informed the king in Mordecai’s name.',
'When this matter was investigated, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a gallows; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the king’s presence.'

'After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes who were with him.',
'All the king’s servants who were in the king’s gate bowed down, and paid homage to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai didn’t bow down or pay him homage.',
'Then the king’s servants, who were in the king’s gate, said to Mordecai, "Why do you disobey the king’s commandment?"',
'Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he didn’t listen to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.',
'When Haman saw that Mordecai didn’t bow down, nor pay him homage, Haman was full of wrath.',
'But he scorned the thought of laying hands on Mordecai alone, for they had made known to him Mordecai’s people. Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even Mordecai’s people.',
'In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, and chose the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.',
'Haman said to King Ahasuerus, "There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, and their laws are different from other people’s. They don’t keep the king’s laws. Therefore it is not for the king’s profit to allow them to remain.',
'If it pleases the king, let it be written that they be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents<f caller="+"> <fr>3:9 </fr><ft>A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds or 965 Troy ounces</ft></f> of silver into the hands of those who are in charge of the king’s business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries."',
'The king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy.',
'The king said to Haman, "The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you."',
'Then the king’s scribes were called in on the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month; and all that Haman commanded was written to the king’s local governors, and to the governors who were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus, and it was sealed with the king’s ring.',
'Letters were sent by couriers into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to plunder their possessions.',
'A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.',
'The couriers went out in haste by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Susa was perplexed.'

'Now when Mordecai found out all that was done, Mordecai tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the middle of the city, and wailed loudly and bitterly.',
'He came even before the king’s gate, for no one is allowed inside the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth.',
'In every province, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.',
'Esther’s maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this, and the queen was exceedingly grieved. She sent clothing to Mordecai, to replace his sackcloth; but he didn’t receive it.',
'Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs, whom he had appointed to attend her, and commanded him to go to Mordecai, to find out what this was, and why it was.',
'So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to city square which was before the king’s gate.',
'Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the destruction of the Jews.',
'He also gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Susa to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to urge her to go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him, for her people.',
'Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.',
'Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai:',
'"All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, know, that whoever, whether man or woman, comes to the king into the inner court without being called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king might hold out the golden scepter, that he may live. I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days."',
'They told Esther’s words to Mordecai.',
'Then Mordecai asked them to return this answer to Esther: "Don’t think to yourself that you will escape in the king’s house any more than all the Jews.',
'For if you remain silent now, then relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another place, but you and your father’s house will perish. Who knows if you haven’t come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"',
'Then Esther asked them to answer Mordecai,',
'"Go, gather together all the Jews who are present in Susa, and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day. I and my maidens will also fast the same way. Then I will go in to the king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish."',

'Now on the third day, Esther put on her royal clothing, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, next to the king’s house. The king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, next to the entrance of the house.',
'When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther came near, and touched the top of the scepter.',
'Then the king asked her, "What would you like, queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom."',
'Esther said, "If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him."',
'Then the king said, "Bring Haman quickly, so that it may be done as Esther has said." So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.',
'The king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, "What is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed."',
'Then Esther answered and said, "My petition and my request is this.',
'If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said."',
'Then Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart, but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he didn’t stand up nor move for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.',
'Nevertheless Haman restrained himself, and went home. There, he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh his wife.',
'Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, the multitude of his children, all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.',
'Haman also said, "Yes, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and tomorrow I am also invited by her together with the king.',
'Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate."',
'Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, "Let a gallows be made fifty cubits<f caller="+"> <fr>5:14 </fr><ft>A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters.</ft></f> high, and in the morning speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on it.

'On that night, the king couldn’t sleep. He commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought, and they were read to the king.',
'It was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs, who were doorkeepers, who had tried to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus.',
'The king said, "What honor and dignity has been given to Mordecai for this?"',
'The king said, "Who is in the court?" Now Haman had come into the outer court of the king’s house, to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.',
'The king’s servants said to him, "Behold,<f caller="+"> <fr>6:5 </fr><ft>"Behold", from "הִנֵּה", means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</ft></f> Haman stands in the court."',
'So Haman came in. The king said to him, "What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor?"',
'Haman said to the king, "For the man whom the king delights to honor,',
'let royal clothing be brought which the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides on, and on the head of which a royal crown is set.',
'Let the clothing and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man whom the king delights to honor with them, and have him ride on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him, ‘Thus it shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!’"',
'Then the king said to Haman, "Hurry and take the clothing and the horse, as you have said, and do this for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king’s gate. Let nothing fail of all that you have spoken."',
'Then Haman took the clothing and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and had him ride through the city square, and proclaimed before him, "Thus it shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!"',
'Mordecai came back to the king’s gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning and having his head covered.',
'Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, "If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail against him, but you will surely fall before him."',
'While they were yet talking with him, the king’s eunuchs came, and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.'

'So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.',
'The king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, "What is your petition, queen Esther? It shall be granted you. What is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed."',
'Then Esther the queen answered, "If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request.',
'For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for male and female slaves, I would have held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king’s loss."',
'Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen, "Who is he, and where is he who dared presume in his heart to do so?"',
'Esther said, "An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman!"',
'The king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden. Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.',
'Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman had fallen on the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, "Will he even assault the queen in front of me in the house?" As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.',
'Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who were with the king said, "Behold, the gallows fifty cubits<f caller="+"> <fr>7:9 </fr><ft>A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters.</ft></f> high, which Haman has made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, is standing at Haman’s house."',
'So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king’s wrath was pacified.'

'On that day, King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the Jews’ enemy, to Esther the queen. Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was to her.',

'Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and begged him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his plan that he had planned against the Jews.',
'Then the king held out to Esther the golden scepter. So Esther arose, and stood before the king.',
'She said, "If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seem right to the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king’s provinces.',
'For how can I endure to see the evil that would come to my people? How can I endure to see the destruction of my relatives?"',
'Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, "See, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, because he laid his hand on the Jews.',
'Write also to the Jews, as it pleases you, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s ring; for the writing which is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, may not be reversed by any man."',

'He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king’s ring, and sent letters by courier on horseback, riding on royal horses that were bred from swift steeds.',
'In those letters, the king granted the Jews who were in every city to gather themselves together, and to defend their life, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, their little ones and women, and to plunder their possessions,',

'Therefore the Judeans of the villages, who live in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, a good day, and a day of sending presents of food to one another.',
'Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both near and far,',

'The side rooms were wider on the higher levels, because the walls were narrower at the higher levels. Therefore the width of the house increased upward; and so one went up from the lowest level to the highest through the middle level.',

'"Behold, there was another animal, a second, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth. They said this to it: ‘Arise! Devour much flesh!’',
'"After this I saw, and behold, another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird. The animal also had four heads; and dominion was given to it.',
'"After this I saw in the night visions, and, behold, there was a fourth animal, awesome and powerful, and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth. It devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet. It was different from all the animals that were before it. It had ten horns.',
'"I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.',
'"I watched until thrones were placed,',
'A fiery stream issued and came out from before him.',
'"I watched at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke. I watched even until the animal was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.',
'As for the rest of the animals, their dominion was taken away; yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.',
'"I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of the sky one like a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.',
'Dominion was given him, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which will not pass away, and his kingdom that which will not be destroyed.',
'"As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved within my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.',

'Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns. The two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.',
'I saw the ram pushing westward, northward, and southward. No animals could stand before him. There wasn’t any who could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.',
'As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west over the surface of the whole earth, and didn’t touch the ground. The goat had a notable horn between his eyes.',
'He came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran on him in the fury of his power.',
'I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and struck the ram, and broke his two horns. There was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled on him. There was no one who could deliver the ram out of his hand.',
'The male goat magnified himself exceedingly. When he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable horns toward the four winds of the sky.',
'Out of one of them came out a little horn, which grew exceedingly great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land.',
'It grew great, even to the army of the sky; and it cast down some of the army and of the stars to the ground, and trampled on them.',
'Yes, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the army; and it took away from him the continual burnt offering, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.',
'The army was given over to it together with the continual burnt offering through disobedience. It cast down truth to the ground, and it did its pleasure and prospered.',
'Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to that certain one who spoke, "How long will the vision about the continual burnt offering, and the disobedience that makes desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the army to be trodden under foot be?"',
'He said to me, "To two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary will be cleansed."',
'When I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it. Then behold, there stood before me something like the appearance of a man.',
'I heard a man’s voice between the banks of the Ulai, which called, and said, "Gabriel, make this man understand the vision."',
'So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was frightened, and fell on my face; but he said to me, "Understand, son of man; for the vision belongs to the time of the end."',
'Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.',
'He said, "Behold, I will make you know what will be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongs to the appointed time of the end.',
'The ram which you saw, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.',
'The rough male goat is the king of Greece. The great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.',
'As for that which was broken, in the place where four stood up, four kingdoms will stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.',
'"In the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have come to the full, a king of fierce face, and understanding dark sentences, will stand up.',

'Through his policy he will cause deceit to prosper in his hand. He will magnify himself in his heart, and he will destroy many in their security. He will also stand up against the prince of princes; but he will be broken without hand.',
'"The vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true; but seal up the vision, for it belongs to many days to come."',

'The former insincerely proclaim Messiah from selfish ambition, thinking that they add affliction to my chains;',

'Yes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you all.',
'In the same way, you also rejoice, and rejoice with me.',
'But I hope in the Lord Yeshua to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing.',
'For I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you.',

'But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your emissary and servant of my need,',

'For indeed he was sick, nearly to death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.',
'I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.',

'that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed to his death,',
'if by any means I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.',
'Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect; but I press on, that I may take hold of that for which also I was taken hold of by Messiah Yeshua.',
'Brothers, I don’t regard myself as yet having taken hold, but one thing I do: forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are before,',
'I press on toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Messiah Yeshua.',
'Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, think this way. If in anything you think otherwise, God will also reveal that to you.',
'Nevertheless, to the extent that we have already attained, let’s walk by the same rule. Let’s be of the same mind.',
'Brothers, be imitators together of me, and note those who walk this way, even as you have us for an example.',
'For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, as the enemies of the cross of Messiah,',
'whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who think about earthly things.',
'For our citizenship is in heaven, from where we also wait for a Savior, the Lord Yeshua the Messiah,',

'I can do all things through Messiah, who strengthens me.',
'However you did well that you shared in my affliction.',
'You yourselves also know, you Philippians, that in the beginning of the Good News, when I departed from Macedonia, no assembly shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only.',

'But I have all things and abound. I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you, a sweet-smelling fragrance, an acceptable and well-pleasing sacrifice to God.',

'For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change made also in the law.',
'For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.',
'For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah, about which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.',

'who doesn’t need, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices daily, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. For he did this once for all, when he offered up himself.',

'But Messiah having come as a high priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,',
'nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption.',
'For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh,',
'how much more will the blood of Messiah, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without defect to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?',
'For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, that those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.',
'For where a last will and testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him who made it.',
'For a will is in force where there has been death, for it is never in force while he who made it lives.',
'Therefore even the first covenant has not been dedicated without blood.',

'or else he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world. But now once at the end of the ages, he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.',
